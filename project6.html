     <h2>A place I would like to visit</h2>
     
       <p> I would love to see Hawaii for myself instead 
       of in movies or pictures. It seems so peaceful and 
       fun to visit, yet expensive.That was always on my bucket 
       list to visit that place. The water looks so fresh 
       and the people seem so nice.</p>

     <h2>A Person I Admire<br>(past or present)</h2>  
        
        <p>A person i admire is Kid Cudi. He is a famous rapper.
        i see him as a poet for anyone who has ever felt like they didn't
        belong or they felt unwanted. He speaks to people using a 
        completely different form of music. The perseverance is visible
        and very admirable.</p>
